To run the game you must: (please contact me if you need help, I will make a tutorial on how to setup everything!)

1. Add an environment variable "ODBC_RS2D_HOME" pointing to a folder containing your DB connection string file, name that file "dbinfo.txt"
2. run an sql server and create a database named "rs2d"
3. run the server
4. run client(s), type username/pw (switch with tab) and then click sign up, or just login if you already have signed up

If the info above is wrong, let me know!

TODO Short term:

- Make resources server side
- Make inventory server side
- Skill experience
- Add an NPC for dialogues
- Add a monster for combat
- Add a quest (4-5 steps)
- Add a bank

TODO Long term:

- Instances (inferno/fight caves/raids/quest areas)
- Multiple Quests, monsters, NPCS, Shops
- Interfaces: shop/bank/etc.
- Skills (No construction probably)
- Clue scrolls
- Quests

Not sure:

- non 07 features
- diaries
- rest of the map
- My version of raids (how I imagined it before it was released)
- Different servers like DMM, fast xp, combat only, etc
