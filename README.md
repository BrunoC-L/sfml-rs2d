# sfml-rs2d
Runescape 2D version Made with C++/SFML - only asset used is the map, the rest is remade by myself

To run the game you must:
1: run the python script "compresser2"
2: run the python scripts "chunk4" & "texturer3"
3: download SFML, place the SFML folder next to the sfml1 folder at the root of the repo (mine is gitignored)
4: copy the SFML DLLs to the debug folder with the .exe created when compiling (go in visual studio, try to debug, it will crash because of missing DLLs and create the debug folders and executable)

If the info above is wrong, let me know!
